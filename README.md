## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance 4×4 matrix multiplication accelerator using a fully pipelined parallel MAC architecture in Verilog.

The design targets the **Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T FPGA** on the Basys-3 development board and demonstrates:

- Balanced adder-tree pipelining  
- DSP48 multiplier inference  
- Timing-aware RTL design  
- Deterministic latency and throughput  

Matrix multiplication is the fundamental compute primitive behind modern AI workloads such as CNNs and Transformers. This project focuses on datapath optimization and digital architecture depth rather than system-level integration.

## 2. Functional Description

The accelerator computes:

C = A × B

Where A and B are 4×4 signed matrices.

Each output element is computed as:

C[i][j] = Σ (A[i][k] × B[k][j])  for k = 0 to 3

Key features:

- 16 parallel compute elements  
- 3-stage pipelined MAC architecture  
- Signed fixed-point arithmetic  
- One output result per clock (steady state)

Each MAC element consists of:

### Stage 1 – Multiplication
- 4 parallel signed multipliers  
- DSP48 inference  
- Registered outputs
